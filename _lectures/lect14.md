        - Preferably ink or dark led
        - PLEASE WRITE LEGIBLY
    - No electronic devices
    - No books
    - No notes

Format
    - Mix of questions
    - Short answer
        - Briefly describe / define / state ...
    - Write code
    - Fill in the blank / complete the table
    - True / False, if false explain why
    - Given code, what is the output ...
    - Similar to midterm 1, expect it to take no more than ~ one hour (maybe sooner).
        - Will cover a broad range of topics, but probably not everything

Topics
    - Will cover everything up to last Thursday's lecture 5/16)
    - Midterm 2 will be cummulative, but with a heavy emphasis on post-midterm 1 material.

Hash Table Topics
    - Know basics of hash functions and performance
        - open-address hashing / double-hashing / chained-hashing
        - map vs unordered_map
        - Implementation details

Mergesort / Quicksort
    - Know the algorithm and how to implement it
    - Understand main ideas and how the array is manipulated as the algorithm executes
    - Know the runtime analysis (best / average / worst cases) and space requirements.

Testing
    - Understand main ideas
        - The tddFuncs way of testing
        - Unit testing
