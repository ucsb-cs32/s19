* <strong> NOTE:</strong> Use these sample exams as additional practice and anticipation of what kind of questions may be asked on the midterm exam. I encourage everyone to work through the problems, but <b>DO NOT</b> base your studying only on these exams. I expect all students to review the material thoroughly.
